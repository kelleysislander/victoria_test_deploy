Explanation of the way the data is structured and used in the Advertisers table, (also see db/advertisers.txt document)

This is a representation of the data in the "Advertisers" table.  Note the firtst 2 recs... This is the  case where the advertiser = retailer, where
the recs have a "retailer_id" that points to the "Retailers" table, hence the empty attributes of address, city, state, etc. since they are stored in
the "Retailers" table

Setting up the app on the remote server:

1.  cap staging deploy:setup => creates the database.yml in shared/config

2.  cap staging deploy => 
  deploys code from git and creates the ".rvmrc" symlink in "current/" for shared/config.rvmrc, and creates the config/database.yml symlink for shared/congig/database.yml

3.  cap staging deploy:migrate => runs the migrations

4. Create the first Admin user =>
  
  deploy@ubuntu-server2:/var/www/vhosts/victoria.semaphoremobile.com/current$ RAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails c
  
  User.create!( :name => "Bill Kiskin", :email => "bill@semaphoremobile.com", :password => "please", :password_confirmation => "please", :roles_mask => "1")

NOTE:  this last statement would not set the value of roles_mask so aftet the user is created we go into console:

user = User.find 3
user.update_attribute( :roles_mask, 1 )
user.save

To run console on the server:

RAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails c

Installing RVM on the server:

sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install curl
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libreadline5-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev

To solve this for the original poster (the gem is fine):

gem update --system
rvm gemset empty yourgemsetname
gem install bundler
gem install

This cleans your local installation and it will work fine. For certain gems you might want to add the following to your boot.rb file at the top:

require 'yaml'
YAML::ENGINE.yamler = 'syck'

require 'rubygems'

Just posting this here so nobody else has to bang their head against
the wall for 10 minutes...

I just upgraded my Rails app from beta1 => beta2, and upgraded Devise
from pre2 => rc0

Rails kept returning this whenever I spun it up:

undefined method `devise' for #<Class:0x10789bea0> (NoMethodError)

and

undefined method `devise_modules' for #<Class:0x10789c0f8>
(NoMethodError)

I had previously configured my app for Devise in the routes.rb with a
#devise_for call and in user.rb with a #devise method call, and these
are what triggered the NoMethodError.

Just comment out these parts first, then run "rails generate
devise_install", and then uncomment again, and it should be fixed.

I'm sorry to hear that. I try to warn when the *devise* method is not
defined in your models:

http://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/rails/r...

But for some reason it seems not be working.

The migration should work smoothly, do you still have the backtraces so I
can try to investigate what was happening?

Thanks!

@Houdini

It looks like you've set Devise to use the User model yet you haven't
migrated to include said table in the database. If you've generated the User
model already, try running "rake db:migrate". If you haven't, you should be
running "rails g model User" along with the fields you wish to set said
Model with. I'd encourage you to look into the Rails guides (
http://guides.rails.info) for more info on migrations (if you're not
familiar with those, that is).

Hope this pointers got you going on the right path.
