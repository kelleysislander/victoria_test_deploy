For a first time deploy or to blow away the data tables and repopulate from seeds.rb:

"cap deploy:setup"

Thereafter:

"cap staging deploy"

then "cap staging deploy:migrations" on the local

OR

"RAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rake db:setup" on the remote server


In case you need to run "cap deploy:setup" again and you donâ€™t want Capistrano to ask for a database password, 
set the skip_db_setup option to true. This is especially useful in combination with capistrano multi-stage 
recipe when you already setup your server and you share the same environment across all the stages.

$ cap deploy:setup -s "skip_db_setup=true"

after that do a "cap deploy:cold" (does migrations) and when that is good do a:

rake db:setup
